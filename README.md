AxHell

This is a simple exploitable ActiveX control I wrote a while back to give people something to play with to learn VR/RE on ActiveX inside IE.

It can be used in a couple of ways:

1) As a source code review example, in which case look at the src folder, specifically the AxHell project.
2) As a blackbox reverse engineering challenge. In which case go straight to the bin folder.

If you get stuck the answers directory contains some, no peeking ;-)

NOTE: Do not install the control on anything you want to keep, it is intentionally fully exploitable :)

AxHell - A simple exploitable ActiveX Control for RE/VR
(c) James Forshaw 2010

Licensed under GPLv3

Installing:

* Copy axhell.dll somewhere local and run 'regsvr32 axhell.dll'

* Copy example.htm and installer.exe to a website (and make sure both can be served), run it to
check it works (you should get a message box appear). 

Rules of the game:

* All functions are vulnerable to something (except GetHint, I just couldn't think of anything good).

* Call GetHint with the name of the hint to get some meaningless text ;)

* A vulnerability does not necessarily mean you get code execution, there are other types of vulnerability

* Assume you can force a user to go to your website, you cannot man in the middle their traffic, redirect their DNS etc. 

* Don't waste too much time on this :)

* Only play with this on an isolated computer, otherwise you _will_ get owned by somebody.
